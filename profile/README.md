## 💡 The Advanced Light Source

The **Advanced Light Source (ALS)** at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov) is a U.S. Department of Energy user facility that provides researchers worldwide with **bright beams of ultraviolet and x-ray light** for studies in physics, materials science, chemistry, and biology.  

Operating a **1.9 GeV electron storage ring** in continuous **top-off mode**, the ALS delivers stable, high-brightness light to nearly **40 beamlines**.  

The upcoming [ALS-U upgrade]((https://als.lbl.gov/als-u/overview/)) will boost brightness by more than 100×, enabling experiments with **nanometer spatial** and **nanosecond temporal** resolution.


## 🚀 Accelerator Physics at the ALS

The **Accelerator Physics Group** develops and operates the accelerator systems that enable the Advanced Light Source to deliver **stable, high-brightness beams** for user experiments.  

We advance **lattice design, insertion devices, beam dynamics, and feedback systems** to ensure **reliable, high-uptime operation** of the light source.  

Building on decades of accelerator expertise, our current efforts focus on **AI-assisted control, data-driven optimization, and digital-twin modeling** to prepare for the **ALS-U era** and the next generation of light-source performance.
